This project was an attempt to create and observe the performance of a particular portfolio of stocks from the S&P 500 via the application of a variety of different statistical models.

The findings of the project are displayed in the Findings PDF document. The source code was all written in R and uses the stockPortfolio package developed in part by the UCLA Statistics Department. The analysis here examines the different models in relation to the overall market S&P 500 index. 

Feel free to download and modify the code for fun or to experiment with! Please keep in mind that I am in no way responsible for any significant market losses and that investing based on these models will be done at your own risk.
